# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working in this repository.

## Project Overview

LocalLLMModels — a repository for working with local large language model (LLM) configurations, model files, and related tooling.

## Repository Structure

This is a new repository. Structure will evolve as content is added.

## Common Commands

<!-- Add build, test, and lint commands here as the project develops -->
<!-- Example: -->
<!-- - **Build**: `make build` -->
<!-- - **Test**: `pytest tests/` -->
<!-- - **Lint**: `ruff check .` -->

## Code Style and Conventions

- Keep documentation up to date as new models or configurations are added.
- Use clear, descriptive names for model configuration files.
- Prefer standard formats (JSON, YAML, TOML) for configuration files.

## Important Notes

- Do not commit large model weight files directly to this repository. Use Git LFS or external storage and reference them instead.
- Keep secrets (API keys, tokens) out of version control.
